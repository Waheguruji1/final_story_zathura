// Anti-Gravity Maze Challenge

'AntiGravityMazeCard': StoryNode(
  text: 'Max rolls the dice again, tension hanging in the air. The number 7 appears. As before, a card materializes, hovering before Max. He grabs it, his face darkening as he reads aloud, "Anti-Gravity Maze." A low hum fills the room, and you feel your stomach lurch as the floor beneath you shimmers and fades. The card’s message rings in your mind: "In the maze where gravity bends, up is down, and down is up. Find the center, or lose your way forever."',
